 Question:  Could the ability to turn off certain sections or change
 their order be an option in the future.  Some users don't need the
 hardware or mISDN sections...

Another thing I noticed.... "make update" is missing, I think I was 
the one that submitted it the last time so could we get that back?
Please....
